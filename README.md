# Introduction, Ideas, Tutorials.
Hello-world, thank you for checking me out.
Currently I am learning Javascript. I find knowing the basics highly important,
although I heard it may stifle my development, having a great understanding of what I am working with, for some odd reason,
is what I seem to find more attractive than finding ways to develop projects. 
However, I am learning, and any insight will be appreciated and would be nice.
